                 <p id="tekst">Star Wars is an American epic space-opera media franchise created by George Lucas. The franchise began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly became a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon.
                <br><br>The original film, later subtitled Episode IV  A New Hope was followed by the sequels Episode V  The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI Return of the Jedi (1983), forming what is collectively referred to as the original trilogy. A prequel trilogy was later released, consisting of Episode I  The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II  Attack of the Clones (2002) and Episode III  Revenge of the Sith (2005). Ten years later, a sequel trilogy began with Episode VII  The Force Awakens (2015), continued with Episode VIII  The Last Jedi (2017), and will conclude with Episode IX  The Rise of Skywalker (2019).<br> <br>[1] The first eight films were nominated for Academy Awards (with wins going to the first two released) and were commercially successful. Together with the theatrical anthology films Rogue One (2016) and Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equates to over US$9 billion,[2] and is currently the second-highest-grossing film franchise."
