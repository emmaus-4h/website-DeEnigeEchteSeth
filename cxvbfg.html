            <p id="tekst"> The Star Wars Trilogy, often colloquially referred to as the original trilogy or the classic trilogy, is the first set of three films produced in the Star Wars franchise, an American space opera created by George Lucas. It was produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by 20th Century Fox, and consists of the original Star Wars film (1977),The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). The films center on the Galactic Civil War of the Rebel Alliance trying to free the galaxy from the clutches of the evil Empire, as well as the archetypical hero's journey of Luke Skywalker in his quest to become a Jedi and face Sith Lord Darth Vader.

Beginning in medias res, the original trilogy serves as the second act of the nine-episode Skywalker Saga. It was followed by a prequel trilogy between 1999 and 2005, and a sequel trilogy between 2015 and 2019. Collectively, they have been referred to as the "Skywalker Saga" to distinguish them from spin-off films set within the same universe. </p>
