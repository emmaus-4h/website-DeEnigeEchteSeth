It is produced by Lucasfilm Ltd. and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The trilogy consists of episodes VII through IX, chronologically following the prequel trilogy (Episodes 1,2,3 1999 2005) and the original trilogy (Episodes 4,5,6 1977 1983). Lucas had planned a sequel trilogy as early as 1976,but had canceled it by 1981 and produced only the first six episodes. The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm in late 2012 and announced plans to produce the sequel films, although Lucas his plans for the films were largely discarded.
